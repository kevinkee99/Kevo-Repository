# Code Block: Reverse List (Python 3)

> **Description**: I created the code block linked below for INFOTC-1040 class assignment. The program is called "Reverse List", and these are the objectives:  
> 1. Write a function that reverses the items of a list in place.
> 2. create a test function to compare if the actual result is the same as the expected result.
