# Page 1: Code Block

> **Description**: This page shows code block that I created for INFOTC-1000 class assignment. This program is called "FizzBuzz" and the purpose of this program is to output nubmer from 1 to 100 with following conditions:
> 1. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with "Fizz".
> 2. If the number is divisible by 5, replace it with "Buzz".
> 3. If the number is divisble by 3 and 5, replace it with "FizzBuzz".
