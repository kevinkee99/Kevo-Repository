# Code Block: Interstate Highway Interactive Function (Python 3)  

> **Description**: I created the code block linked below for INFOTC-1040 class assignment. This program is called "interstatehighway_interactive_function", and these are the objectives:  
> 1. Keep asking the user for a highway number until the number they enter is valid.  
> 2. Ask the user if they want to know the type or the direction of the valid highway number.  
> 3. Print the corresponding information.
